# R-Value and Management R Calculations

**IMPORTANT:** These calculations are critical to the trade management feature. Do not modify without careful consideration and testing.

## Core Concepts

### R (Risk Unit)
- **R = 1** represents the current risk of the trade
- For **Long**: `R = entry_price - stop_loss`
- For **Short**: `R = stop_loss - entry_price`

### R-Multiple (Actual R)
The actual performance of the trade measured in risk units.

- For **Long**: `Actual R = (exit_price - entry_price) / R`
- For **Short**: `Actual R = (entry_price - exit_price) / R`

### Commission Adjustment (Net R Values)

**All displayed R values are NET of commissions and fees.** This ensures apples-to-apples comparison between Actual R and Target R.

```
Commission R = total_commission / risk_amount
Actual R (Net) = Actual R (Gross) - Commission R
Target R (Net) = Target R (Gross) - Commission R
```

For Management R calculations, both the actual outcome and the ghost scenario (what would have happened) include commissions, so they cancel out when comparing. This means Management R reflects pure trade management skill independent of commission costs.

### Stop Loss for R Calculations
R values use the **current** stop loss, not the original. The `risk_level_history` field tracks historical stop loss moves for display purposes (showing "Saved R" from SL moves), but R calculations always use the current stop loss value.

### Fixed-Dollar-Risk Users (issue #345)
When a user's `default_stop_loss_type` is `dollar`, their risk per trade is a **constant dollar amount** (`default_stop_loss_dollars`), so **1R is that fixed dollar amount on every trade — even when the stop is later trailed**. This is the one place the "use the current stop loss" rule above is overridden: for dollar-risk users the risk unit stays anchored to the planned dollar risk, not the (possibly moved) current stop distance.

This applies consistently across all three R surfaces:

- **Dashboard / analytics aggregate** (`TradeQueries.getAnalytics`): derives R as `pnl / dollar_risk`. Because `pnl` is already in dollars (futures/option multiplier applied), this needs no per-instrument multiplier and reconciles exactly: `SUM(R) = SUM(pnl) / risk`.
- **R-Multiple Analysis & R-Performance chart** (`calculateRMultiples`): the per-share risk becomes `dollar_risk / (qty × multiplier)` and `riskAmount` becomes `dollar_risk`, so actual R, target R, weighted target R, and R-lost all share that unit.
- **Management R** (`TargetHitAnalysisService.calculateManagementR`): same per-share risk substitution, so planned/management R stay consistent.

Deriving risk from each stored stop instead skewed results — winners trailed to/above breakeven yielded a NULL/≤0 price-based risk and dropped out, while losers with a tight stored stop blew up the denominator. The dollar substitution is gated on dollar mode; **percent-stop users keep the per-trade `(entry − stop) × qty × multiplier` derivation unchanged.** The controller loads the setting via `getUserDollarRisk(userId)` and threads `{ dollarRisk }` into both functions.

## Weighted Target R (Potential R)

For trades with multiple take profit targets, calculate the weighted average of all target R values.

### Data Structures

Two possible data structures exist for take profit targets:

**Structure 1:** `take_profit_targets` contains ALL targets with explicit shares
```json
{
  "take_profit": 6885.5,
  "take_profit_targets": [
    {"price": 6885.5, "shares": 7},
    {"price": 6822.25, "shares": 1}
  ],
  "quantity": 8
}
```
Detection: `firstTargetPrice === take_profit` OR `sum(target.shares) >= quantity`

**Structure 2:** `take_profit` is TP1, `take_profit_targets` are additional targets
```json
{
  "take_profit": 105.00,
  "take_profit_targets": [
    {"price": 110.00, "shares": 1}
  ],
  "quantity": 8
}
```
TP1 shares = `quantity - sum(target.shares)`

### Formula

```
For each target:
  target_R = (target_price - entry) / R  [long]
  target_R = (entry - target_price) / R  [short]
  contribution = target_R * (shares / total_shares)

Weighted Target R = sum of all contributions
```

### Example (Short Trade)

- Entry: 6902.75, Current SL: 6909, Quantity: 8 contracts
- R = 6909 - 6902.75 = 6.25 points
- TP1: 6885.5 (7 contracts) → R = (6902.75 - 6885.5) / 6.25 = 2.76R
- TP2: 6822.25 (1 contract) → R = (6902.75 - 6822.25) / 6.25 = 12.88R

**Weighted Target R** = (2.76 × 7/8) + (12.88 × 1/8) = 2.415 + 1.61 = **4.025R**

## Management R

Management R measures how well the trade was managed relative to what was planned.

**Core Formula:** `Management R = Actual R - Planned R`

| Scenario | Planned R | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **SL Hit First** (no partial exits) | -1R | Full position would have stopped out |
| **SL Hit First** (with partial exits) | TP1 contribution + (remaining × -1R) | TP1 captured, remaining would have stopped |
| **TP Hit First** | Weighted Target R | All targets hit perfectly |

### SL Hit First

When the stop loss was hit before the final take profit target:

```
Management R = Actual R - Planned R
```

**No Partial Exits:**
- Planned R = -1R (full stop out)
- Example: Entry 100, SL 90, Exit 102 (long)
  - Risk = 10 points
  - Actual R = (102 - 100) / 10 = +0.2R
  - Planned R = -1R
  - **Management R = 0.2 - (-1) = +1.2R** (exited 1.2R better than planned)

**With Partial Exits:**
- Planned R = (TP1_R × TP1_ratio) + (remaining_ratio × -1R)
- Example (Short Trade):
  - Entry: 6902.75, Current SL: 6909, Quantity: 8 contracts
  - TP1 hit: 7 contracts at 2.76R → contribution = 2.76 × (7/8) = 2.415R
  - Remaining: 1 contract (1/8 = 0.125)
  - Planned R = 2.415 + (0.125 × -1) = 2.29R
  - Actual R = 2.42R (weighted exit)
  - **Management R = 2.42 - 2.29 = +0.13R**

**Key Insight:** SL Move Impact (R saved from moving stops) is already captured in the Actual R vs Planned R difference. A moved stop loss changes the exit price, which changes Actual R, which is compared against the Planned R (based on original stop).

### TP Hit First

When the take profit was hit before the stop loss:

```
Management R = Actual R - Weighted Target R
```

This measures how much better or worse you did compared to your potential.

**Example:**
- Actual R (weighted exit): 2.42R
- Weighted Target R: 4.025R
- **Management R = 2.42 - 4.025 = -1.61R** (missed potential)

## Target R Curve (R-Performance Chart)

The cumulative Target R curve in the R-Performance chart shows what you **expected** to achieve based on your target hit analysis.

### Logic

The curve CANNOT stay flat - it either goes **down by -1R** or **up by the weighted Target R**:

| Target Hit Analysis | Target R Added |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **SL Hit First** | **-1R** (expected to lose 1R) |
| **TP Hit First** | **Weighted Target R** (expected to hit all targets) |
| **Not Set** | Nothing (trade not yet analyzed) |

### Example

Three trades with these settings:
1. Trade 1: SL hit first → Target R = -1R → Cumulative = -1R
2. Trade 2: TP hit first (weighted target R = +4.03R) → Cumulative = +3.03R
3. Trade 3: SL hit first → Target R = -1R → Cumulative = +2.03R

### Why -1R for SL Hit First?

When you enter a trade with a stop loss, your **expected outcome if stopped out** is -1R (losing your defined risk). If the stop loss was hit first, the "target" (expected) performance for that trade was -1R, regardless of where your take profit targets were set.

This is different from Weighted Target R (which assumes all targets hit) - it reflects the **actual expected outcome** based on what happened.

## Key Rules

1. **Use current stop loss** for R calculations (risk_level_history is only for tracking move history)
2. **All R values are NET of commissions** - both Actual R and Target R include commission adjustment
3. **Detect data structure** before calculating weighted target R
4. **SL Hit First** = Actual R (net) - Planned R (net), where Planned R = -1R - commissionR
5. **TP Hit First** = Actual R (net) - Weighted Target R (net)
6. **Infer remaining ratio** from partial exits when not stored in history

## Test Case

Use this data to verify calculations:

```javascript
const trade = {
  entry_price: 6902.75,
  exit_price: 6887.63,
  stop_loss: 6902.5,  // Moved from 6909
  take_profit: 6885.5,
  take_profit_targets: [
    {price: 6885.5, shares: 7},
    {price: 6822.25, shares: 1}
  ],
  quantity: 8,
  side: 'short',
  risk_level_history: [
    {type: 'stop_loss', old_value: 6909, new_value: 6902.5}
  ]
};

// Expected Results:
// R (risk unit) = 6.25 points
// Weighted Target R = 4.025R
// SL Hit First → Management R = 0.13R
// TP Hit First → Management R = -1.61R
```
